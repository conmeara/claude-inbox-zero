   - Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
   - Click on "2-Step Verification" and follow the setup

2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
   - Select "Mail" from the dropdown
   - Select your device (or choose "Other" and name it "Email Agent")
   - Click "Generate"
   - **Copy the 16-character password** (you won't see it again!)

3. **Configure `.env`**:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password  # NOT your regular password!
